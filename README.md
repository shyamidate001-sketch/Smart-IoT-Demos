## üìÇ Projects

### 1. ESP32 Soil Moisture Controlled Pump
- Reads soil moisture sensor (analog).
- Controls a water pump/relay automatically based on soil dryness.
- Status logs printed via Serial Monitor.

**Applications:** Smart irrigation, garden watering, agriculture.

---

### 2. ESP8266 Web Server (Relay Control)
- Creates its own WiFi Access Point.
- Simple web page to turn a relay (or LED) ON/OFF.
- No external router required.

**Applications:** Smart home relay/light control, retrofitting appliances.

---

### 3. ESP32 MQTT Sensor Publisher
- Reads temperature & humidity from DHT11/DHT22 sensor.
- Publishes data to an MQTT broker.
- Ready for cloud dashboard integration (Node-RED, ThingsBoard, Home Assistant, etc).

**Applications:** Remote monitoring, dashboards, automation.
